## Challenge Overview
There was a lot of information to process and the time requiered to create an outcome was substantial, overall this tested a lot of my coding and I failed many times.
Through those failures, I did learn how to overcome them and now I know how to achieve success in those areas. The gitbash was very difficult and i realize that organization 
is important in the beginning.
## Challenge Summary
Based on the data, it is very clear the candidate who won is, Diana De Gette with 73.8% of the vote. That is significantly higher than her opponents.
